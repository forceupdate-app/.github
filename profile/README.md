### Paul Uhler

Discover the wide range of use cases where App Upgrade can be a valuable tool for your app development needs.

### Mandatory App Updates

In certain cases, it may be necessary for users to always use the latest version of an app, particularly for compliance with security regulations. This can require significant effort from both developers and users to ensure everyone is on the same version.

### Infrastructure Maintenance

App developers may need to perform infrastructure maintenance or server application migrations, which can take time and shift focus away from developing important features. This can result in delays and a slower pace of development.

### Bug Fixing

It's not uncommon for apps to have major bugs in certain versions, which can negatively impact user experience. Developers must ensure that users are not using these versions, and may need to release a force app update to fix the issue.

### App Discontinuation

In some cases, an app may need to be discontinued. This can be a challenging process, particularly to ensure that users are not left with a negative impression of the app or its developers. Developers must ensure that this process is as smooth and seamless as possible.

### Difficulty Updating App

Sometimes users are unable to update their app, which can prevent them from accessing important updates like security enhancements and compatibility fixes. This can result in a compromised user experience and may put users at risk.

### Platform/OS Incompatibility

As mobile operating systems evolve, older versions may no longer support certain libraries or internal tools, which can impact the functionality of an app. This can lead to user frustration and potentially damage an app's reputation.
